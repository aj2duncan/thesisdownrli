The basic language or `R Markdown` documents is (perhaps unsurprisingly) [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). This is a markup language which allows a plain text file (not pointing or clicking) to be turned into amongst other things HTML. `R Markdown` extends this and adds things like `R` code chunks and certain elements of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to allow plain text documents to produce amongst other things Word, PDF, HTML documents, websites and books.  

The [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package extends R Markdown and enables some more LaTeX functionality which is useful for scientific writing. It also easily facilitates the compilation of multiple R Markdown documents into a single final document. `thesisdownrli` has added a custom LaTeX template to build a pdf thesis out of R markdown chapters.  
## Markdown

Most of an R Markdown file is made up of plain text. Small bits of *markup* change plain text into formatted text. Headings are preceded by a particular number of `#`

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
```

It is also possible to add bold, italic etc:

- `_italic_` or `*italic*` produces _italic_ or *italic*
- `__bold__` or `**italic**` produces __bold__ or **bold**
- `R^2^` produces R^2^
- `R~2~` produces R~2~

Lists require at least one clear line break from the preceding paragraph.

```
1. item 1
2. item 2
  i. subitem i
  ii. subitem ii
3. item 3
```

would produce 

1. item 1
2. item 2
  i. subitem i
  ii. subitem ii
3. item 3

or they can be unordered

```
- item 1
- item 2
  - subitem i
  - subitem ii
- item 3
```

- item 1
- item 2
  - subitem i
  - subitem ii
- item 3


## `R` 

It is not necessary actually run any code from the thesis chapters but you have this option. To run code it needs to be enclosed in an **R chunk**. An example is shown below. Note the 3 backticks and *r* above the line of code and the 3 backticks to close. In this case the chunk is also named *pressure*. This name can be used to refer to the chunk, which is necessary for referencing figures - more information below.  

```{r summary, verbatim = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```


`R` can also be included inline as `r rinline("2+2")`. The code itself won't be printed only the result of `r 2 + 2`. This means variables (and their values) can be directly printed. 

For example a value can be stored as part of some work:
```{r initial_props, verbatim = TRUE}
S_in = 0.99
I_in = 0.01
R_in = 0
``` 

We can then type something like:

> The initial proportions of susceptible, infected and resistant individuals were `r rinline("S_in")`, `r rinline("I_in")` and `r rinline("R_in")` respectively. 

Which would print out:

> The initial proportions of susceptible, infected and resistant individuals were `r S_in`, `r I_in` and `r R_in` respectively. 

Using values in text like this means that if for some reason the data changes slightly, it isn't necessary to change all the values in text - they will change automatically the next the document is *knitted*.

## Figures

Each plot produced from an `R` chunk will become a figure, with a caption if provided. 

```{r chunk-name, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of Pressure", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, verbatim = TRUE}
plot(pressure)
``` 

As the figure chunk has a name, this can be referenced using the syntax `\@ref(fig:chunk-name)`. **Note:** Be careful to add the `fig:` before the chunk name here. For this to work the chunk name can only contain letters, numbers and dashes. 

So in text we would have.

> Figure `\@ref(fig:chunk-name)` shows a scatterplot of pressure against temperature.

Images that haven't been generated with directly from an `R` chunk or a source `R` file into an R markdown document. There are a couple of ways to do so but the best method for a thesis is to use a code chunk like the one below. A little bit of `R` code is used to *include the graphics*. Ideally the image should be in a subfolder. 

```{r other-image, eval = FALSE, verbatim = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/file.png")
```

This method allows for figure captions and references to be used as above. 

For all additional guidance on `R` plots and figures in bookdown please refer to the official [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html).

## Equations

We can insert nicely formatted LaTeX equations in all R Markdown documents. An example would be 

```
\begin{equation}
y = k e^{(\alpha - \beta)t} 
\end{equation}
```

which would produce 

\begin{equation}
y = k e^{(\alpha - \beta)t} 
\end{equation}

and there are more examples below. 

However, in order to add numbers to these equations and refer back to them we need to use the added functionality provided by `bookdown`. To do that we need add a label in the form `(\#eq:equation-label)`. For example:

```
\begin{equation}
y = k e^{(\alpha - \beta)t} 
(\#eq:example-eqn)
\end{equation}
```

which can be referenced using similar syntax as figures `\@ref(eq:example-eqn)`. 

As with figures for more detail please refer to the official bookdown [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#equations)

### A (Very) Brief Guide LaTeX Syntax

Below are some examples of how to use certain mathematical notation.

- Powers: `x^2` would become $x^2$.
- Roots: `\sqrt{x}` would become $\sqrt{x}$.
- Subscripts: `x_1` would become $x_1$.
- Brackets `(x^2)` would become $(x^2)$. If you want them to automatically become the correct size you can use `\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)` which will produce $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$.
- Greek letters: `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\delta`, `\epsilon` and `\gamma` would become $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, $\epsilon$ and $\gamma$.
- Fractions: `\frac{3}{2}`would become $$\frac{3}{2}$$
- To get the normal derivative we use particular font:

```
\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{dy}}{\textrm{dx}} = x
\end{equation}
```

\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{dy}}{\textrm{dx}} = x
\end{equation}

- To align multiple equations we use the `\begin{align}` environment where all the `&` will line up and we indicate a new line with `\\`. Don't put a new line after the last equation. 

```
\begin{align}
\frac{\textrm{dy}_1}{\textrm{dx}} &= x \\
\frac{\textrm{dy}_2}{\textrm{dx}} &= x \\
\frac{\textrm{dy}_3}{\textrm{dx}} &= x 
\end{align}
```

\begin{align}
\frac{\textrm{dy}_1}{\textrm{dx}} &= x \\
\frac{\textrm{dy}_2}{\textrm{dx}} &= x \\
\frac{\textrm{dy}_3}{\textrm{dx}} &= x 
\end{align}
