It is possible to use `thesisdownrli` without RStudio but it will probably work best with it. 

### From RStudio

There are two ways to use `thesisdownrli` with RStudio. 

1. If you generally make use of RStudio projects then you can open a new thesis project (using thesisdownrli and bookdown) from the list of *New Project* options.

This will create a new RStudio project in a folder containing all the template files needed. 

2. If you don't use RStudio projects you can create a similar template folder from an *R Markdown* template. Use File -> New File -> R Markdown... then choose *From template*, then choose *Thesis-RLI*, and enter `index` as the *Name*. This will create a new folder titled *index*. Once this has been created you can rename the folder. **Note:** The temporary files will currently only **Knit** if you name the directory `index` when creating it.

### Without RStudio

If you're not using RStudio, run this line in your R console to create a new PhD dissertation from the template:

```{r}
rmarkdown::draft('index.Rmd', template = 'thesis', 
                 package = 'thesisdownrli', create_dir = TRUE)
```

## Creating Your Thesis

If you have followed the steps above then hopefully you will have a new folder containing some template R markdown files amongst other things. To test whether everything is working ok you should now open the file named *index.Rmd* (if it isn't already open) and click the **Knit** button at the top.
